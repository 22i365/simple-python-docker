# 🐳 Simple Python Docker App

## 📄 What I Did
- Created a basic Python script (`app.py`) that prints "Hello from inside the Docker container!".
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to containerize the script using a Python base image.
- Built the Docker image using terminal commands.
- Ran the container to execute the script inside an isolated Docker environment.
- Verified the output and confirmed successful execution inside the container.
